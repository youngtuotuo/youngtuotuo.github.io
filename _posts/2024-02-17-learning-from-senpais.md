title: Learning From Senpai Quotes
---

As a late-joined engineer from mathematics, I heavily rely on expert's quotes
to help myself learning, thinking, and most importantly, avoiding shits.

This blog is a collection of "I wanna inform myself these when I started learning
programming."

If any Senpai I mentioned here thinks I quote you out of context, please feel free
to inform me.

This blog is not a click-bait "5000000 things I hope I know when start
programming 40000 miliseconds ago." And waste your time reading it with tons of
positive, encouraging, but totally non-practical shitty statements. You can
only learn these by experiences, making mistakes, apologizing to your
colleagues, and, ignoring idiots. You'll never understand what those quotes
mean by simply reading them.

If anyone, also a newbie programmer, see this article, think of these quotes as
"my possible future mindsets when I improves", not as "oh those experts also
think this, so I don't need to remove my knowledge gaps.".

    Note: "they" refers to those who you think are darn good engineers.

    > have to see all of the details before they really get it, and, usually
    > they have to do it and then they'll change some stuff after they're like:
    > "Oh, I see how that went now, I'm going to revise what I did because
    > there was a better way.

    Hey, me, it's okay to feel "What the hell is going on?" when you face a
    python error, a pytorch error, a strange C++ syntax, a cool
    [vim](https://www.youtube.com/@TheVimeagen)/[emacs](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily)
    navigation video, a [vtuber](https://www.youtube.com/@AsahiLina/featured)
    writing macbook m-series gpu driver for Fedora by reverse engineering, a
    [cute turtle](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) creates a lovely chat bot
    even beofre GPT goes viral. Need not to feel inferior, just keep your own
    pace, keep your own speed, strive with real problems, learn from real
    problems, dive deeper and deepr as you can. You'll eventually realize that
    everything are not that difficult like Advanced Calculus, ODE, PDE. Just
    learn them, think them, go to sleep, and you improve.

    It's okay to be ignorant, it's not okay to not admit ignorance. I think
    you've been able to recognize your own ignorance, so you are good. You'll
    eventually find out youself standing out from those never improves, from
    those always have excuses, from those pretend knowing everthing, you will.
    You don't need to put too much attention on them and hope they'll change,
    no, they are idiots. Pay more attentions to those deserve, to those you
    love.

    When it comes to learning from the internet, you'll find lots of resources,
    tutorials, courses, discussions, etc. That's the awesome part of the
    internet. But the dark side is, most of them look more like gossip. Why
    we need to care what text editor to choose when you are learning how a
    computer system works? You may falls into a dilemma to think youself need to 
    learn everything the community discuss about, so that you won't fall behind
    to any person. THAT'S TOTALLY WRONG.


    + Avoid:
        
        + The best X in Y.
        + A day in the life as X. (They'll get fired when big layoff.)
        + X tier lists.
        + What people think X is, what it actually is.
        + Short videos.
        + Social media.
        + Introducing X, a [positive adjective]...
        + Announcing X, a [positive adjective]...
        + Do X when Y
        + X is the best in Y I've ever seen.
        + Learn X in Y mins. (And stop learning)
        + Long tutorial with lots of shit talks that only bring you from level
        1 to level 3.
        + Community from any platform.<br><br>

    + Read:

        + Books used by college courses.
        + Detail articles consist of pure words, codes. Not fancy color, fancy
        icons, fancy blocks.
        + Senpai's blog.
        + Courses with paid wall (sort of, you still need to investigate to
        make sure they deserve).
        + Github long form implementation.
        + Real programming videos (all codes, with explanations, target in
        serious project instead of framework tutorial).
        + Real discussions from senpais.<br><br>

    + Appreciate:

        + Contents need tons of cost with totally free access.<br><br>

    > I don't respect people if they think they deserve respect. There are
    > people who think that respect is something that should be given. I'm
    > perfectly happy saying No. Respect should be earned. Without being
    > earned, you don't get it.

    Only being polite, friendly, respectful to those who deserved, not
    everyone. Anyone declares those good attitudes should be given to all human
    beings is those people not able to introspect, to face the reality, to
    understand their limitation, and, only try to ask others to tolerate their
    failures, idiots, selfishness.

    + If you meet sales/pm/hr trying to say something like "If you do it well
    this time, the salary increase will definitely let you happy.", "I
    understand your pains, let's face the real problem next meeting." DO NOT
    TRUST THEM, DO NOT RESPECT THEM.
    + If your manager do something like "I don't agree with you, let me ask
    A.", and A comes to ask you, and A answer back to the manager, and the
    manager comes to you again and said "See, A agree with me. So I think we
    should...". DO NOT RESPECT THE MANAGER.
    + If anyone using serious terms like "GPT", "RL", "LLM", "Kalman Filter" as
    fancy term to fulfill their vanity without knowing any details behind. DO
    NOT RESPECT THEM.
    + If anyone feels angry or sad when they are pointed out their false (of
    source, you don't even humiliate them). DO NOT COLLABORATE WITH
    THEM.

    Always do these:
    + NEVER trust any oral statements/commitments. Only trust those well
    recorded, no matter in audio or in paper. All of the related person needs
    one copy of the records. At the end of any oral commitments, say one more
    thing: "I'm glad we meet an agreement. To protect all of us, let's write
    down what we agree in paper and submit them to all realted people." You can
    also ask for recording all the discussions right before each meetings. If
    anyone disagree, don't waste time on these dogshit.
    + Always clarifying the accountability throughout the process. Guess what?
    When idiots found they need to take the responsibilities (and you record
    well, so that they can't declare it's false afterward) they'll behave like
    a coward.<br><br>

    His takes are all my favorites cuz' he totally pointed out how problematic
    the whole environment is. I've mostly met all kinds of idiots he
    mentioned.

    Career

    > The beginning of your career when you're young and have a lot of energy
    > is very important. You need to use it effectively because it'll determine
    > your trajectory for the rest of your life. If you start a career at a
    > company that gives you a medicore things to do, you're gonna trun
    > yourself into a mediocre web programmer.

    Imposter Syndrome

    > There is a real psychological effect called imposter syndrome, but that's
    > not what everybody on the internet is talking about. People on the
    > internet seized that name, and used it inappropriately for their accurate
    > feeling that they don't know what they're doing at their job. Most people
    > are bad at their job and don't know what their doing. That's not a
    > syndrome. That's an accurate depiction of the situation. People want to
    > pretend it's not true that they're bad at their job. They want to pretend
    > that they're actually good, and it's just a mental issue, it's just
    > confidence or something.

    Environment
    
    > For new programmers what would I broadly say about choosing a career path
    > in programming. The same thing I always say which is be careful what you
    > choose, especially when you're very young. Because when you're young,
    > it's the time you're really learning and the time when you're still
    > defining yourself. I mean you're still always defining yourself but when
    > you're young, you're especially doing that because you have less history
    > behind you. If you go somewhere medicore, and you learn from people who
    > are doing medicore work, you're gonna be defining yourself as someone who
    > doesn't do things that are particularly good or particularly special. ...
    > If you're lucky, you can break yourself out of that later. But better
    > never to be in that situation. So, choose where you work and who you work
    > with very carefully.

    Life

    > I think people tell themselves all the time they're gonna to do that, and
    > then they just age into their financially stable choice. ... Your
    > propensity for taking risks will only be reduced as you age. ... When
    > you'are 43, you'll have way way more reasons to be conservative than when
    > you were 23. So if you don't learn to take risks now, you will not do it
    > later.

    Money

    > If you have money of any magnitude, and you have a theory about how to do
    > something productive, then you should invest that money in your own
    > theory, if you believe it has a good chance of being right. Because
    > you're most in control of that and there are fewest middleman skimming
    > off of that. The highest return comes from you investing that money in
    > your own idea. All these things like putting it in an index fund or a
    > mutual found or whatever, that's all for if you don't have an idea of how
    > to make any money. Which is fine for people who don't want to have an
    > idea or don't want to take any risks. But if you do, there are better
    > things to do.

    Doing Stuffs

    > People who succeed do stuff that nobody else was doing because the other
    > people talk themselves out of doing the thing. That's the secret that you have
    > to know. Everybody is talking themselves out of success all the time.

    Standing Out
    
    > You need to stand out from other people in order to really succeed at a lot
    > of things. And people are afraid of standing out from other people because
    > when you stand out from the herd, you get taken down by a mountainn lion or
    > whatever. ... You might be just looking for ways to not succeed while thinking
    > that you tried your hardest.
