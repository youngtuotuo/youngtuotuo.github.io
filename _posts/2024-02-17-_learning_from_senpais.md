title: Learning From Senpai Quotes
---

As a late-joined engineer from mathematics, I heavily rely on expert's quotes to help myself learning, thinking, and most importantly, avoiding shits.

This is a collection of "I wanna inform myself these when I started learning programming."

This is not a click-bait "5000000 things I hope I know when start programming 40000 miliseconds ago."
You can only learn these by experiences, making mistakes, apologizing to your colleagues, and, ignoring idiots.

If anyone, also a newbie programmer, see this article, think of these quotes as "my possible future mindsets when I improves",
not as "oh those experts also think this, so I don't need to remove my knowledge gaps.".

    Note: "they" refers to those who you think are darn good engineers.

    > Even them, don't really have the ability to think through an entire complex programming problem,
    > without actually doing the programming. They have to see all of the details before they really get
    > it, and, usually they have to do it and then they'll change some stuff after they're like:
    > "Oh, I see how that went now, I'm going to revise what I did because there was a better way.

    Hey, me, it's okay to feel "What the hell is going on?" when you face a python error, a pytorch error, a strange C++ syntax,
    a cool [vim](https://www.youtube.com/@TheVimeagen)/[emacs](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily) navigation video, a [vtuber](https://www.youtube.com/@AsahiLina/featured) writing macbook m-series gpu driver for Fedora by reverse engineering,
    a [cute turtle](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) creates a lovely chat bot even beofre GPT goes viral.
    Need not to feel inferior, just keep your own pace, keep your own speed, strive with real problems, learn from real problems, dive deeper and deepr as you can.
    You'll eventually realize that everything are not that difficult like Advanced Calculus, ODE, PDE.
    Just learn them, think them, go to sleep, and you improve.

    It's okay to be ignorant, it's not okay to not admit ignorance. I think you've been able to recognize your own ignorance, so you are good.
    You'll eventually find out youself standing out from those never improves, always have excuses, pretend knowing everthing, you will.
    You don't need to put too much attention on them and hope they'll change, no, they are idiots. Pay more attentions to those deserve, to those you love.

    > There are a lot of videos on YouTube/TikTok etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are really just entertainment.
    > This is very convenient for everyone involved : the people watching enjoy thinking they are learning (but actually they are just having fun).
    > The people creating this content also enjoy it because fun has a much larger audience, fame and revenue. But as far as learning goes, this is a trap.

    + Avoid:
        
        + The best X in Y.
        + A day in the life as X. (They'll get fired when big layoff.)
        + X tier lists.
        + What people think X is, what it actually is.
        + Short videos.
        + Social media.
        + Introducing X, a [positive adjective]...
        + Announcing X, a [positive adjective]...
        + Do X when Y
        + X is the best in Y I've ever seen.
        + Learn X in Y mins. (And stop learning)
        + Long tutorial with lots of shit talks that only bring you from level 1 to level 3.
        + Community from any platform.<br><br>

    + Read:

        + Books used by college courses.
        + Detail articles consist of pure words, codes. Not fancy color, fancy icons, fancy blocks.
        + Senpai's blog.
        + Courses with paid wall (sort of, you still need to investigate to make sure they deserve).
        + Github long form implementation.
        + Real programming videos (all codes, with explanations, target in serious project instead of framework tutorial).
        + Real discussions from senpais.<br><br>

    + Appreciate:

        + Contents need tons of cost with totally free access.
