title: How Difficult It Is To Focus More Than 30 Minutes Nowdays
---

By means of focus, I refer to stick to one single complicated mission for a
long time. You can still rest, drink, go to pee in this period, but you won't
transfter to another mission. I don't refer to sitting like a robot to finish
classical Asian educational style homework. (For any Aisian feels racism here,
I'm a fucking Taiwanese.)

For those programmers have the improving mindset, each of them will agree the
simple phrase "*Just learn everything.*" (Basics, not trend.) This is a life long
decision. It's good to let us keep learning, accept new concepts, filter useless
stuffs, etc.

I love this take, and I also believe this take will guide me to learn how the
tech transforms. I believe in "*The more I know, the more I feel comfortable
in tech.*" The internet connects all the world, the language model gradually
replace any learning paradigm, we can easily get any resource we want. It's way
more easier than before to learn.

But,

I found I couldn't focus like I was 10 years ago. When I'm reading a tech
blog, I frequently transfer to other materials every 2-5 minutes, e.g. Jblow's
take, The Primeagen's reaction videos, other tech blogs, etc. I came back to
the original blog after I realizing I was off topic, and I need to read the
same paragraph again to recap where I was. I repeat this over and over again.

Eventually, most of my time spend on transferring materials and recaping
knowledge, not actually learning. I guess this is the original sin came with
tech. Tech improvements let us reach any simple goal way faster than before,
this tells our dopamine system that "There are many new stimulation we can
seize.". So our behavior gradually tranforms from "focus on one thing at least
for 4 hours" to "keep changing our mission at hands", in order to keep chasing
more stimulation. The problem is, domapine's mission is chasing
stimulation, not focusing or learning. More concretely, nowdays I'll chase
transferring more intuitively than chase focusing.

Here's my actual experience, when I'm reading a blog post explains how DALLE 2
works, I have these tabs opening:

+ Handmade Hero Episode (Learning win32 api and C)
+ Performance-Aware Programming Series (Learning from senior)
+ The CC4E website. (I forgot how to implement hash map in C)
+ The Meta's new LLM-based test agent. (from The Primeagen's videos)
+ The pirate software's ferret live stream. (really cute BTW)
+ Youtube
+ Twitter

also, I have multiple tmux windows with these working directory (fol...LOL):

+ yolor
+ yolov7
+ yolov9
+ tinygrad
+ A compiler writing journey
+ Writing an interpreter in Go

moreover, a file explorer window consists of more than 20 arxiv papers in it.
Among these, I'm in a discord voice channel with my friends.

Look at this, lots stimulation are there that my brain can chase.

To alleviate, I follow one belief, and all practical stuffs stem from this belief.

> Human can only do one serious thing in a long period.

Like we are just a single core, single thread chip.

Here are the practical principles:

1. Turn off music, even if lofi style or white noise.
2. Use workspace to split your missions.
3. Use window to split your sub-missions.
4. Avoid tons of tabs.
5. Close windows are not related to current mission.
6. Close all mission related windows when go to sleep.
7. Use browser profile to split your work and personal tabs.
8. Use noise-cancelling headphones.
9. Fullscreen.
10. Hide task bars.
